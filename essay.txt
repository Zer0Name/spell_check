Whch would you rther be a cat or a hmuman? I believe that the best answer to this question is to be a cat. It would be amazing if there was a technology availbe that could turn you into a cat. That would solve all of my problems. I can give you three reasons why this would be great. First of all, as a cat you would never need to go to schol because, well, you are a cat. In fact, you would not even need to leavve your houes. Second, no one will ever order you raound. Everyone knows that cats do not do what they are asked. They have a mind of their own, making them independent creatures of the night. Thirdly, and most importantly, as a cat you can sleep all day. Who would not want to lie around all day doing nothing with nobody bothering you? Anyway, if cats uniteed Toether, they can govern the entire world. The devlopmnet of this technology would most definitely make the world a better place. Unlike cumbersome people, cats rule!
